# Hyathi Technologies Full Stack Development Task - Virtual Pokemon Adoption App

## Task

The app will allow users to:

- Register and log in.
- View available Pokemon for adoption (each Pokemon has different attributes like breed, age, health status, etc.).
- Adopt a Pokemon (Each user can adopt multiple Pokemon, but each Pokemon can be adopted only once).
- Once a Pokemon is adopted, the user can feed the Pokemon (each feeding increases Pokemon's health status).
- If a Pokemon isn't fed for a certain time (ex: 24 hours), its health status decreases.
